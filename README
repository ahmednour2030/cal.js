cal.js is a small Javascript library that activates basic HTML and turns it
into a dynamic calendar widget. By registering callbacks, any external data-
source or other visual components can be integrated in a loosely coupled way.

This way, cal.js doesn't add any structural HTML to the document and doesn't
impose any visual design. It merely updates a set of tags according to a basic
convention: just identify 35 elements in your HTML and cal.js will use these
to render any month.

The examples/ directory contains examples that integrate cal.js with Google
Calendar, visualizing a public calendar or use the commits of a GitHub hosted
project, to visualize its history.
